This isn’t to say the book is all bad. Razzle actually has quite a few valid points and insights. He isn’t a stupid man. He also shares several philosophical viewpoints with the aforementioned Ayn Rand. Razzle presents the whole pimp/prostitute dynamic in a romantic light that is a bit unfounded though.
