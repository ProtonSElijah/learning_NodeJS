There is a lot of repetition as well. The author loves to say the exact same thing over and over just dressed a little differently. It wasnâ€™t unlike reading an Ayn Rand novel. It was akin to playing a video game from the 80s where you keep dying on a level and have to start said level over again. You get a little further each time, but you go over the same stuff a lot. See what I just did there?
